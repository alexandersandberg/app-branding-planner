# App Branding Planner

![](/preview.png)

This is a tiny tool that helps you preview your app's branding on the App Store.

I use this myself to plan a good name and subtitle for my apps.

Currently, only the app's `name` and `subtitle` is available to preview, but I will add more things later on.
